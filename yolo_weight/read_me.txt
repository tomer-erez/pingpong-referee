tiny pp was created on 2400 images of pingpong extracted from a game, filmed at 120 fps so the ball is pretty and round

i found that in runtime, when the ball reaches high speed, on 60 fps video, sometimes yolo misses the detection

tiny pp pixeled was created to solve that. its based on the same data(2400) plus 980 images of pingpong extracted from 60 fps video, so the training includes a lot of pixeled and squashed balls images.
that was with the purpose of trying to solve the missing balls by training on "bad" pictures.

tiny table is a yolo tiny algorithm to detect the table and net
